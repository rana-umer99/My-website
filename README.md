This platform gives you a brief intrdouction about myself. I have created it to show-case some the works that I have done during my professional career.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): This is the offical styling framework used for building this website.

Some other plugins that I have used in this project are as follows:

[lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/): lightbox is used for modals and popups
[swiper](https://swiperjs.com/): A plugin used for galleries and sliders.
[aos](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/): animate on scroll styling library added for fading animation effects.

Project Structure
The project uses a mostly flat structure with a key folders and files:

assets folder: This is where all of the projects styles, javascript, fonts (if any) and images live, each on their own folder for better organization.
from folder: Froms are a seprate entity and contains seprate logic which is writter in PHP and that's why I've kept them in seprate folder.
package.json: Where our dependencies, browserlist config and NPM scripts live. - Note: Since we mainly use yarn for our local development, youâ€™ll also see a yarn.lock file on the project.
Everything else are the HTML templates.
