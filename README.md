# Description #

This website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences to potential employers, clients, and visitors. The design is visually appealing, and the website is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on various devices.

# Project Structure #
The project uses a mostly flat structure with a key folders and files:

- `assets folder`: This is where all of the projects styles, javascript, fonts (if any) and images live, each on their own folder for better organization.
- `from folder`: Froms are a seprate entity and contains seprate logic which is writter in PHP and that's why I've kept them in seprate folder.
- `package.json`: Where our dependencies, browserlist config and NPM scripts live. - Note: Since we mainly use yarn for our local development, youâ€™ll also see a yarn.lock file on the project.
Everything else are the HTML templates.
