Description
This website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences to potential employers, clients, and visitors. The design is visually appealing, and the website is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on various devices.

Some plugins that I have used in this project are as follows:

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): This is the offical styling framework used for building this website.
[lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/): lightbox is used for modals and popups
[swiper](https://swiperjs.com/): A plugin used for galleries and sliders.
[aos](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/): animate on scroll styling library added for fading animation effects.

Project Structure
The project uses a mostly flat structure with a key folders and files:

assets folder: This is where all of the projects styles, javascript, fonts (if any) and images live, each on their own folder for better organization.
from folder: Froms are a seprate entity and contains seprate logic which is writter in PHP and that's why I've kept them in seprate folder.
package.json: Where our dependencies, browserlist config and NPM scripts live. - Note: Since we mainly use yarn for our local development, youâ€™ll also see a yarn.lock file on the project.
Everything else are the HTML templates.
